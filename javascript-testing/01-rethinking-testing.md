# Rethinking Testing

## Always failing
- When airplane manufacturers test wing structure, they keep putting pressure on and flex the wings until the wings break off.
- It is a test that will never pass.
- The manufacturers define an expectation, and they validate it.
- **A test is a validation of an expectation.**
