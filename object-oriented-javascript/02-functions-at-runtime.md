# Functions at Runtime

## Functions are first-class functions
- Functions can:
  - be stored in variables
  - be returned from a function
  - be passed as arguments into another function
- A function that takes other functions as arguments (and/or returns a function) is known as a *higher-order function*.
- A function that is passed as an argument into another function is called a *callback function*.
