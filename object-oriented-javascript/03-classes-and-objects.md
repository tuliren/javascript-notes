# Classes and objects

## Constructor function
  - Persist data with the `this` keyword.
  - No explicit return value.
  - Can have parameters.
```js
function SoftwareDeveloper(name) {
  this.favoriteLanguage = 'JavaScript';
  this.name = name;
}
```

## Creating a new object
- Use the `new` operator.
```js
let developer = new SoftwareDeveloper('David');
```
- When the `new` operator is not used, no object is created.
  - The function is invoked like a regular function.
  - Since there is no return value, the variable will be assigned to `undefined`.

## The `instanceof` operator
- This operator confirms whether an object is created by a specific constructor function.
- This operator actually tests whether the constructor appears in the prototype chain of an object.
```js
object instanceof ClassName;
// return a boolean

typeof object
// "object"
```

## `this` in objects
- A value for `this` is set when a method is invoked on an object, and that value refers to that object.
- Four ways to call functions
  - Calling a constructor function with the `new` keyword sets `this` to a newly-created object.
  - Calling a method sets `this` to the object that owns the method.
  - Calling a function on its own (i.e. invoking a regular function) sets `this` to `window`.
  - Calling a function with `call` or `apply` allow customization of `this`.

## `call()`
- Set `this` to custom objects.
```js
// this variable is set to thisObject in the invocation
function.call(thisObject, arguments)
```

- Invoke functions attached to objects (i.e. methods).
```js
const mockingbird = {
  title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
  describe: function () {
    console.log(`${this.title} is a classic novel`);
  }
};

const pride = {
  title: 'Pride and Prejudice'
};

mockingbird.describe.call(pride);
// 'Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel'
```

## `apply()`
- Pass in arguments in an array.
- Useful when the number of arguments is unknown.
```js
function.apply(thisObject, [arguments])
```

## `bind()`
- When methods are passed in as a callback, `this` reference may be lost.
```js
function invokeTwice(cb) {
   cb();
   cb();
}

const dog = {
  age: 5,
  growOneYear: function () {
    this.age += 1;
  }
};

// growOneYear is passed in as a function, so
// this inside growOneYear is set to windows,
// and the age is not updated
invokeTwice(dog.growOneYear);

dog.age;
// 5
```

- Use anonymous closure to close over the `dog` object.
```js
invokeTwice(function () {
  // growOneYear is directly call onto the dog object
  dog.growOneYear();
});

dog.age;
// 7
```

- `bind()` method provides an less verbose alternative approach.
- It is called onto a function and returns a copy of that function with a specified this value.
```js
const growOneYearMethod = dog.growOneYear.bind(dog);
invokeTwice(growOneYearMethod);
dog.age;
// 7
```

## `prototype`
- Each function has a `prototype` property. `prototype` is an object.
- An object created by the `new` operator of a constructor function is linked to its constructor's `prototype`.
- This link allows the object to access the `prototype`'s properties and methods as if it were its own.
- Whether accessing a property or invoking a method, the JavaScript interpreter looks for them along the prototype chain in this order:
  - The object's own properties.
  - The object's constructor's `prototype`.
  - At the very end of the chain is the `Object()` object, or the top-level parent.
  - If the property still cannot be found, the property is `undefined`.
- By adding methods to the `prototype`, memory is saved as more objects are instantiated.

```js
function Dalmatian (name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// register a method on the prototype
Dalmatian.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} barks!`);
};
```

- When new methods are added to `prototype`, existing objects can access the new methods as well.
- When `proprotype` is replaced, objects created before the replacement are still linked to the old `prototype`. Objects created after the replacement are linked to the new `prototype`.

```js
function Cat() {
  this.color = 'white';
}

let cat1 = new Cat();
cat1.color;
// white
cat1.meow();
// exception

Cat.prototype = {
  isHungry: false,
  meow: function () {
    return 'Meow!';
  }
};
// new properties and methods are not available
// for existing objects
cat1.isHungry;
// undefined
cat1.meow();
// exception

let cat2 = new Cat();
cat2.color;
// white
cat2.meow();
// Meow!
cat2.isHungry;
// false
```

## Relevant Methods
- `hasOwnProperty()`
  - `hasOwnProperty()` allows user to find the origin of a particular property.
  - This method takes in a string of the property name, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the property belongs to the object itself (i.e. that property was not inherited).
-  `isPrototypeOf()`
  - This method checks whether or not an object exists in another object's `prototype` chain.
  - It can be used to confirm if a particular object serves as the prototype of another object.
-  `Object.getPrototypeOf()`
  - This method retrieves the prototype of a given object.
- `constructor`
  - A property that returns a reference to the constructor function that creates the object.
  - Objects created with literal notation are constructed with the `Object()` constructor function.

## `__proto__`
- An object is secretly linked to its constructor function's `prototype` object through that instance's `__proto__` property.
```js
object.__proto__ === object.constructor.prototype;
// true
```

- It is highly discouraged to reassign the `__proto__` property, or even use it in any written code.
  - There are compatibility issues across browsers.
  - Since the JavaScript engine searches and accesses properties along the prototype chain, mutating an object's prototype can lead to performance issues.

## Inheritance
- Inheritance in JavaScript is all about setting up the `prototype` chain.
  - Users should not use `__proto__` to manage inheritance.
  - Users should not inherit only the prototype, because this doesn't set up the prototype chain, and any changes made to a child object will also be reflected in a parent object.

```js
// inappropriate
Child.prototype = Parent.prototype
```

- Use `Object.create()` to manage inheritance without altering the prototype.
- This method takes in a single object as an argument, and returns a new object with its `__proto__` property set to the argument passed into it.
- Objects created with this method extend from the passed in argument.
```js
const mammal = {
  vertebrate: true,
  earBones: 3
};
// rabbit extends mammal
const rabbit = Object.create(mammal);
console.log(rabbit.__proto__ === mammal);
// true
```

- Create inheritance
```js
function Animal (name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.walk = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} walks!`);
};

function Cat (name) {
  // call super constructor; use call
  // instead of new operator so that
  // no Animal object is created
  Animal.call(this, name);
  this.lives = 9;
}

// link Cat.prototype.__proto__ to Animal.prototype
Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// now Cat's constructor is set to Animal
Cat.prototype.constructor
// Animal

// so its constructor needs to be changed back
Cat.prototype.constructor = Cat;

// add a method only shared by Cat objects
Cat.prototype.meow = function () {
  console.log('Meow!');
};

const bambi = new Cat('Bambi');
bambi.meow();
bambi.walk();
bambi.name;
```
