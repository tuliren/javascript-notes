barks!`);\n};\n\n\nWhen new methods are added to prototype, existing objects can access the new methods as well.\nWhen proprotype is replaced, objects created before the replacement are still linked to the old prototype. Objects created after the replacement are linked to the new prototype.\n\nfunction Cat() {\n  this.color = 'white';\n}\n\nlet cat1 = new Cat();\ncat1.color;\n// white\ncat1.meow();\n// exception\n\nCat.prototype = {\n  isHungry: false,\n  meow: function () {\n    return 'Meow!';\n  }\n};\n// new properties and methods are not available\n// for existing objects\ncat1.isHungry;\n// undefined\ncat1.meow();\n// exception\n\nlet cat2 = new Cat();\ncat2.color;\n// white\ncat2.meow();\n// Meow!\ncat2.isHungry;\n// false\n\nRelevant Methods\n\nhasOwnProperty()\nhasOwnProperty() allows user to find the origin of a particular property.\nThis method takes in a string of the property name, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the property belongs to the object itself (i.e. that property was not inherited).\n\n\nisPrototypeOf()\nThis method checks whether or not an object exists in another object's prototype chain.\nIt can be used to confirm if a particular object serves as the prototype of another object.\n\n\nObject.getPrototypeOf()\nThis method retrieves the prototype of a given object.\n\n\nconstructor\nA property that returns a reference to the constructor function that creates the object.\nObjects created with literal notation are constructed with the Object() constructor function.\n\n\n\n__proto__\n\nAn object is secretly linked to its constructor function's prototype object through that instance's __proto__ property.\n\nobject.__proto__ === object.constructor.prototype;\n// true\n\n\nIt is highly discouraged to reassign the __proto__ property, or even use it in any written code.\nThere are compatibility issues across browsers.\nSince the JavaScript engine searches and accesses properties along the prototype chain, mutating an object's prototype can lead to performance issues.\n\n\n\nInheritance\n\nInheritance in JavaScript is all about setting up the prototype chain.\nUsers should not use __proto__ to manage inheritance.\nUsers should not inherit only the prototype, because this doesn't set up the prototype chain, and any changes made to a child object will also be reflected in a parent object.\n\n\n\n// inappropriate\nChild.prototype = Parent.prototype\n\n\nUse Object.create() to manage inheritance without altering the prototype.\nThis method takes in a single object as an argument, and returns a new object with its __proto__ property set to the argument passed into it.\nObjects created with this method extend from the passed in argument.\n\nconst mammal = {\n  vertebrate: true,\n  earBones: 3\n};\n// rabbit extends mammal\nconst rabbit = Object.create(mammal);\nconsole.log(rabbit.__proto__ === mammal);\n// true\n\n\nCreate inheritance\n\nfunction Animal (name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nAnimal.prototype.walk = function () {\n  console.log(`${this.name} walks!`);\n};\n\nfunction Cat (name) {\n  // call super constructor; use call\n  // instead of new operator so that\n  // no Animal object is created\n  Animal.call(this, name);\n  this.lives = 9;\n}\n\nCat.prototype.constructor === Cat\n// true\n\n// link Cat.prototype.__proto__ to Animal.prototype\nCat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);\n\n// now Cat prototype's constructor is set to Animal\n// https://stackoverflow.com/a/20830553\nCat.prototype.constructor\n// Animal\n\n// so its constructor needs to be changed back\nCat.prototype.constructor = Cat;\n\n// add a method only shared by Cat objects\nCat.prototype.meow = function () {\n  console.log('Meow!');\n};\n\nconst bambi = new Cat('Bambi');\nbambi.meow();\nbambi.walk();\nbambi.name;\n\n"},"object-oriented-javascript/04-object-oriented-design-patterns.html":{"url":"object-oriented-javascript/04-object-oriented-design-patterns.html","title":"Object-oriented design patterns","keywords":"","body":"Object-Oriented Design Patterns\nSingle inheritance\n\nAn object's .prototype property points to just one object.\nThis is because JavaScript only supports single inheritance.\n\nFactory Functions\n\nA factory function is a function that returns an object, but isn't itself a class or constructor.\nWe can invoke a factory function as a normal function without using the new operator to avoid the complexity of classes and constructors.\n\nfunction Basketball(color) {\n  return {\n    color: color,\n    numDots: 35000\n  };\n}\nconst orangeBasketball = Basketball('orange');\nconsole.log(orangeBasketball);\n// { color: 'orange', numDots: 35000 }\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nFactory Function\nConstructor Function\n\n\n\n\nCan create new object each time\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCan receive arguments\nYes\nYes\n\n\nImplicate prototypal inheritance\nNo\nYes\n\n\nInvocation\nNormal functionfactoryFunc()\nWith the new operatornew ConstructorFunc() \n\n\n\nMixins\n\nA mixin is a technique that takes the properties and methods from one object and copies them over to another object.\nMixin is not meant to be added to the prototype chain.\n\nObject.assign()\n\nObject.assign() is a method that (shallow) copies an object's own (non-inherited) properties from one or more source objects into a target object, then returns the updated target object.\nObject.assign() does not create and return a new object. It directly modifies then returns the same target object that was passed in.\nValues of existing properties will be overwritten.\nThis method is introduced in ES2015 (ES6).\n\ntarget = Object.assign(target, source1, source2, ...);\n\nFunctional Mixins\n\nA functional mixin is a composable factory function that receives a mixin as an argument, copies properties and methods from that mixin, and returns a new object.\nFunctional mixins are composable. We can use them as individual pieces of code that add specific properties like an assembly line.\n\nfunction CoffeeMaker(object) {\n  let needsRefill = false;\n\n  return Object.assign({}, object, {\n    pourAll: function () {\n      needsRefill = true;\n    },\n    isEmpty: function () {\n      return needsRefill;\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nconst mixedCoffeeMaker = CoffeeMaker({ style: 'percolator' });\n\n// mixedCoffeeMaker is equivalent to\n{\n  style: 'percolator',\n  pourAll: function () {\n    needsRefill = true;\n  },\n  isEmpty: function () {\n    return needsRefill;\n  }\n}\n\nPrivate Properties\n\nJavaScript has no concept of private properties out-of-the-box. There is no special syntax or keyword we can use to protect certain properties from being accessed.\nSome object properties and method names may be prefixed with an underscore (_). It They are private by convention only.\nwe can use scope and closures to create a private state.\n\nfunction myCounter() {\n  let count = 0;\n\n  return function () {\n    count += 1;\n    return count;\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter = myCounter();\n\ncounter();\n// 1\n\ncounter();\n// 2\n\nModule Pattern\n\nUse function scope, closure, and IIFE.\n\nlet moduleVar = (function () {\n  return {\n    // privatr variable\n    let privateVar = 'private variable';\n    return {\n      // setter\n      setVar: function (varValue) {\n        privateVar = varValue;\n      }\n      // getter\n      getVar: function () {\n        return privateVar;\n      }\n    }\n  };\n}());\n\n\nAdvantages of module pattern:\nPrivate properties\nUsage of IIFE that prevents pollution of global scope\nCode organization\n\n\n\nRevealing Module Pattern\n\nWhile we still maintain encapsulation (as in the Module Pattern), we also reveal certain properties (and methods).\nKey ingredients to the Revealing Module Pattern:\nAn IIFE (wrapper)\nThe module content (variables, methods, objects, etc.)\nA returned object literal with keys pointing to data to be revealed\n\n\n\nlet person = (function () {]\n  // private properties\n  let privateAge = 0;\n  let privateName = 'Andrew';\n  // private method\n  function privateAgeOneYear() {\n    privateAge += 1;\n    console.log(`One year has passed!
